        <p style="text-align: justify;">A sworn translator in Poland is a person of public trust who translates and interprets texts from one language into another and authenticates documents translated by others. The main focus of that profession is to cooperate with courts, prosecutors, the police, and public administration bodies. A sworn translator authenticates the translation with their signature and an imprint of their official seal.</p>
