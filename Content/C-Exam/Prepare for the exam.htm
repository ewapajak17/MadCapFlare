        <p style="text-align: justify;">The successful completion of the exam for sworn translators requires solid preparation. Since a sworn translator is primarily involved in translating legal and court documents, a thorough understanding of both the Polish and the Anglo-Saxon legal system is necessary. Find useful literature regarding the exam, Polish-English legal translations and vocabulary in <MadCap:xref href="../D-More/Literature.htm" alt="Literature">Literature</MadCap:xref>. Examples of texts from the exam may be found in <MadCap:xref href="Sample materials.htm" alt="Sample materials">Sample materials.</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, candidates need to know the principles of performing certified translations. For this purpose, it is helpful to read the Code of Professional Conduct for Sworn Translators developed by TEPIS (The Polish Society of Sworn and Specialized Translators). You may find it at the <a href="https://tepis.org.pl/kodeks-tlumacza-przysieglego/" alt="Website of Tepis">Website of Tepis</a>.</p>
