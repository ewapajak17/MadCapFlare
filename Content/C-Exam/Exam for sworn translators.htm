        <p><b>Written exam</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the written exam, candidates translate four texts (two texts from Polish into a foreign language and two texts from a foreign language into Polish). At least one of the texts is a court document, official letter or legal text. The written exam lasts four hours. In order to successfully pass the written part, a candidate needs to obtain 150 points (out of 200 points).</p>
        <div class="Note"><b>Note</b>: Only candidates who pass the written exam are admitted to the oral exam. The oral exam takes place not earlier than 7 days after the written exam.</div>
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-weight: bold;">Oral exam</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the oral exam, candidates interpret two texts read by the speaker in Polish <a href="../D-More/Vocabulary.htm">(consecutive interpreting</a>) into a foreign language. Next, they receive two written texts in English, have 2 minutes to read each text and then they translate them orally into Polish (<a href="../D-More/Vocabulary.htm">sight interpreting</a>). Again, a candidate needs to obtain 150 points (out of 200 points) to pass the exam.</p>
