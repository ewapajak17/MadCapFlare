        <h1>Vocabulary</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Consecutive interpreting</b> is a form of interpretation when an interpreter speaks after a speaker has finished a segment of speech. Consecutive interpretation requires an excellent memory, thorough knowledge of comprehensive vocabulary in different areas and note-taking skills.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sight interpreting</b> (also known as sight translation) is a form of interpretation when an interpreter reads a text in one language and simultaneously interprets it into another language. Sight interpreting is performed in real-time as opposed to consecutive interpreting when the speaker pauses to allow the interpreter to convey the message.</p>
